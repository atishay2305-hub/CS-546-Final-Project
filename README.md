# Description:
The proposed solution is to create a community application portal for Stevens Institute of Technology students that allows them to interact with each other, access information about ongoing events, and share their own posts. This platform aims to enhance engagement and interaction among students by providing a dynamic and interactive way to communicate with each other. Use cases include organizing music jams or sporting events, and students can view and join such events through the community app.
